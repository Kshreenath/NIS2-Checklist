# NIS2 Compliance Package for SMBs

A comprehensive, open-source compliance toolkit for small and medium-sized businesses implementing the EU NIS2 Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) cybersecurity requirements.

**Shared by K. Shreenath Bohra**

---

## 📋 Overview

The NIS2 Directive establishes mandatory cybersecurity requirements for essential and important entities across the European Union. This package provides practical, actionable templates and tools to help organizations—particularly those with 50-250+ employees—achieve compliance efficiently.

### What Makes This Different

- **SMB-Focused**: Designed for organizations without dedicated compliance teams
- **Practical Over Theoretical**: Operational playbooks, not abstract frameworks
- **Efficiency-Oriented**: Highlights overlaps with GDPR and ISO 27001 to reduce duplication
- **Evidence-Based**: Uses regulatory language and actual Article references
- **Freely Available**: Released for community benefit



### Format Choice

Documents are provided in **RTF (Rich Text Format)** rather than proprietary formats to ensure:
- **Accessibility**: Can be opened with any word processor (LibreOffice, Word, Google Docs, etc.)
- **Version Control**: Text-based format works better with Git
- **Long-term Viability**: Open standard not tied to specific vendor
- **Editability**: Easy to customize without expensive software
